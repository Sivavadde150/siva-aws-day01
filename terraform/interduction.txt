# What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure and resources using declarative configuration files.

## Use Cases

- **Provisioning Cloud Infrastructure:** Automate the creation of servers, databases, networks, and other resources on AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.
- **Multi-Cloud Deployments:** Manage resources across multiple cloud providers from a single configuration.
- **Immutable Infrastructure:** Recreate infrastructure from code, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
- **Version Control:** Store infrastructure definitions in source control for collaboration and auditing.
- **Self-Service Infrastructure:** Enable teams to provision their own resources safely and efficiently.

## Example

```hcl
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

This example provisions an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform.
