# This Ansible playbook automates the installation and starting of the Apache web server on a group of target hosts called 'webservers'.
# 
# Step-by-step explanation:
# 1. The playbook is named "Install and start Apache" for clarity.
# 2. The 'hosts' field specifies the target group of servers (webservers) where the tasks will be executed.
# 3. 'become: yes' ensures that all tasks are run with elevated (sudo) privileges.
# 4. The 'vars' section defines variables used in the playbook, such as 'http_port' set to 80.
# 5. The 'tasks' section lists the actions to perform:
#    - The first task installs the Apache package ('apache2') using the 'apt' module, ensuring it is present.
#    - The second task starts the Apache service using the 'service' module.
# 
# This playbook is intended for Debian/Ubuntu systems where 'apt' is the package manager.
