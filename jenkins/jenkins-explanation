# Jenkins Notes

## What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

## Key Features
- **Easy Installation:** Java-based, runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Extensible:** 1800+ plugins for integration with tools (Git, Maven, Docker, etc.).
- **Distributed Builds:** Supports master-agent architecture.
- **Pipeline as Code:** Define build pipelines using Groovy-based Jenkinsfile.
- **Easy Configuration:** Web UI for job and system configuration.

## Jenkins Architecture
- **Master:** Schedules jobs, dispatches builds to agents, monitors agents.
- **Agent (Slave):** Executes build jobs assigned by the master.

## Common Jenkins Terminology
- **Job/Project:** A runnable task (build, test, deploy).
- **Build:** Execution of a job.
- **Node:** Machine that runs Jenkins agent.
- **Pipeline:** Workflow of automated steps.
